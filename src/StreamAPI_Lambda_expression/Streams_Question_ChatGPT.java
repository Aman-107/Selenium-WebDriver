Here are some **Java Stream API**-related questions for practice, categorized by difficulty level:

### **Basic Level**
1. **Filter and Collect:**
   - Write a program to filter out all even numbers from a list of integers and collect the remaining numbers into a new list.

2. **Map Transformation:**
   - Given a list of strings, convert each string to uppercase using streams.

3. **Sort and Limit:**
   - Given a list of integers, sort them in descending order and return the top 3 numbers.

4. **Count:**
   - Count the number of strings in a list that start with the letter 'A'.

5. **Sum:**
   - Calculate the sum of all odd numbers in a list.

### **Intermediate Level**
6. **Grouping:**
   - Group a list of strings by their length using the `Collectors.groupingBy()` method.

7. **Distinct and Sorted:**
   - Remove duplicate elements from a list of integers, sort the list, and collect it into a new list.

8. **Custom Comparator:**
   - Given a list of employees (name, age, salary), sort them by salary in ascending order using streams.

9. **FlatMap:**
   - Flatten a list of lists of integers into a single list of integers.

10. **Joining:**
    - Given a list of strings, join them into a single string separated by commas.

### **Advanced Level**
11. **Partitioning:**
    - Partition a list of integers into two groups: one containing even numbers and the other containing odd numbers.

12. **Find Min and Max:**
    - Find the employee with the highest and lowest salary in a list of employees using streams.

13. **Reduce:**
    - Given a list of integers, find the product of all the numbers using the `reduce()` method.

14. **Parallel Streams:**
    - Demonstrate the use of parallel streams by processing a large list of numbers.

15. **Performance Comparison:**
    - Compare the performance of a stream and a parallel stream while summing up numbers from 1 to 1,000,000.
    
### **Domain-Specific Questions**
16. **Filtering Names:**
    - Given a list of names, filter out all names that have more than 5 characters and are not in uppercase.

17. **CSV Processing:**
    - Read a CSV file into a list of objects (e.g., Student(name, marks)) and filter students with marks greater than 80.

18. **Stock Analysis:**
    - Given a list of stock prices, find the highest price, the lowest price, and the average price using streams.

19. **Transaction Analysis:**
    - Given a list of transactions (id, type, amount), calculate the total amount for each transaction type.

20. **Custom Predicate:**
    - Write a custom predicate to filter numbers divisible by both 3 and 5, then use it in a stream.
